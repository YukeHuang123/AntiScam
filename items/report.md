# [G0 - Team Name] Report

The following is a report template to help your team successfully provide all the details necessary for your report in a structured and organised manner. Please give a straightforward and concise report that best demonstrates your project. Note that a good report will give a better impression of your project to the reviewers.

Note that you should have removed ALL TEMPLATE/INSTRUCTION textes in your submission (like the current sentence), otherwise it hampers the professionality in your documentation.

*Here are some tips to write a good report:*

* `Bullet points` are allowed and strongly encouraged for this report. Try to summarise and list the highlights of your project (rather than give long paragraphs).*

* *Try to create `diagrams` for parts that could greatly benefit from it.*

* *Try to make your report `well structured`, which is easier for the reviewers to capture the necessary information.*

*We give instructions enclosed in square brackets [...] and examples for each sections to demonstrate what are expected for your project report. Note that they only provide part of the skeleton and your description should be more content-rich. Quick references about markdown by [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/help/)*

## Summary of Individual Contributions

Specific details of individual contribution of each member to the project.

Each team member is responsible for writing **their own subsection**.

A generic summary will not be acceptable and may result in a significant lose of marks.

*[Summarise the contributions made by each member to the project, e.g. code implementation, code design, UI design, report writing, etc.]*

*[Code Implementation. Which features did you implement? Which classes or methods was each member involved in? Provide an approximate proportion in pecentage of the contribution of each member to the whole code implementation, e.g. 30%.]*

*you should ALSO provide links to the specified classes and/or functions*
Note that the core criteria of contribution is based on `code contribution` (the technical developing of the App).

*Here is an example: (Note that you should remove the entire section (e.g. "others") if it is not applicable)*

## Code Design and Decisions

This is an important section of your report and should include all technical decisions made. Well-written justifications will increase your marks for both the report as well as for the relevant parts (e.g., data structure). This includes, for example,

- Details about the parser (describe the formal grammar and language used)

- Decisions made (e.g., explain why you chose one or another data structure, why you used a specific data model, etc.)

- Details about the design patterns used (where in the code, justification of the choice, etc)

*Please give clear and concise descriptions for each subsections of this part. It would be better to list all the concrete items for each subsection and give no more than `5` concise, crucial reasons of your design.

<hr>

### Data Structures

*[What data structures did your team utilise? Where and why?]*

Here is a partial (short) example for the subsection `Data Structures`:*

*I used the following data structures in my project:*

1. *LinkedList*
   * *Objective: used for storing xxxx for xxx feature.*
   * *Code Locations: defined in [Class X, methods Z, Y](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/comp2100/group-project/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/items/media/_examples/Dummy.java#L22-43) and [class AnotherClass, lines l1-l2](url); processed using [dataStructureHandlerMethod](url) and ...
   * *Reasons:*
      * *It is more efficient than Arraylist for insertion with a time complexity O(1)*
      * *We don't need to access the item by index for xxx feature because...*
      * For the (part), the data ... (characteristics) ...

2. ...

## Implemented Features

*[What features have you implemented? where, how, and why?]* <br>
*List all features you have completed in their separate categories with their featureId. THe features must be one of the basic/custom features, or an approved feature from Voice Four Feature.*

### Basic Features
1. [LogIn]. Log in refers to the process where users enter their username and password on a login page to verify their identity and grant them access privileges. User information is stored in Firebase. If the username and password entered on the login page are correct, the user logs in successfully and is redirected to the app's main page. Otherwise, a toast message pops up, indicating that the username or password is incorrect.

   Two pre-existing accounts have been added to Firebase: 

   Username: [comp6442@anu.edu.au](mailto:comp6442@anu.edu.au), Password: comp6442 

   Username: [comp2100@anu.edu.au](mailto:comp2100@anu.edu.au), Password: comp2100  (easy)<br>

   * Code: 

     Class [LoginActivity](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7558707/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/antiscam/act/LoginActivity.java#L1-225) 

     **????** Class [FirebaseAuthManage](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7558707/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/antiscam/singleton/FirebaseAuthManager.java#L1-72)

2. [DataFiles].2,500 scam cases were created, including information such as post user, post date, scam type, title, description, etc. The data files were stored in JSON format and then batch-imported into Firebase as a collection. (easy)

   * Code

     Data File [scamCase.json](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7558707/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/assets/scamCase.json), 

     Class LoginActivity

     ​	- Method [updateFirestore](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7558707/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/antiscam/act/LoginActivity.java#L164-224)

   * Link to the Firebase repo: [scam_cases](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/antiscam-5b447/firestore/data/~2Fscam_cases)

3. [LoadShowData]. When a user is logged in and redirected to the main menu, scam cases listed on the main menu will be loaded from Firebase every 10 seconds. Since each scam case contains both scam case information and user information, we load and combine them together, presenting them as a single scam case card. If a new post is added, upon returning to the main page, the data on the main page will also be refreshed. If a user clicks on a scam case card, they will be directed to the detailed information page for that scam case. Additionally, the user's avatar will also be loaded from Firebase. (Medium)

   - Code

     Class [act/MainMenu](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7558707/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/antiscam/act/MainMenu.java)

4. [Search] Users are able to search for scam case information on app. Search feature utilises the Tokenizer and Parser. Combined searches are supported. (medium)

   - Search token, combine symbol and compare symbol

     | Token | Search target |
     | :---- | ------------- |
     | @     | user email    |
     | #     | title         |
     | %     | amount        |
     | $     | scam type     |

     The symbols '&' (for 'and') and '|' (for 'or') are used, as well as the comparison symbols '=', '<',  '>' and so on. 

   - Code

     Class [act/SearchResultActivity](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7558707/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/antiscam/act/SearchResultActivity.java)

     <br>

### Custom Features
Feature Category: Greater Data Usage, Handling and Sophistication <br>
1. [Data-Profile]. A user profile page has been created, which includes the user's profile image and username. Users can also modify their profile picture and username on this page by clicking image or username.  (easy)
   
   * Code:
   
     Class [act/Profile](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7558707/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/antiscam/act/Profile.java) 
   
     Class [act/UpdateProfile](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7558707/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/antiscam/act/UpdateProfile.java)
   
     Class [adapter/ScamCaseCardProfileAdapter](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7558707/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/antiscam/adapter/ScamCaseCardProfileAdapter.java)
   
     Class [tool/CircleImageTransformer](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7558707/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/antiscam/tool/CircleImageTransformer.java)
   
2. [Data-Deletion]. Users can delete posts they've created. When a user clicks 'Delete,' the corresponding data will be removed from the Firebase scam_case collection, at the same time, the data will also be deleted from AVLTree (We implemented LRU and a custom underlying data structure of LRU named "TreeHashMap"). After deletion, user posts list will be refreshed. (medium)

   - Code:

     Class act/Profile 

     ​	- Method [onDelBtnClick](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7558707/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/antiscam/act/Profile.java#L126-159)<br>

     ​	- Method [deletePost](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7558707/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/antiscam/act/Profile.java#L292-312)

Feature Category: Firebase Integration <br>
3. [FB-Auth] Use Firebase to implement User Authentication.  (easy)

   * Code: 

     Class act/LoginActivity

     ​	- Method [logIn](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7558707/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/antiscam/act/LoginActivity.java#L135-149) 

     ​	- Method [onStart](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7558707/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/antiscam/act/LoginActivity.java#L126-133)

4. [FB-Persist] Use Firebase to persist all data used in app. User could add posts and the data will be stored in Firebase. Without restarting, when other users swipe down, the scam case list will be updated synchronously as the Firebase is updated. This means that users will be able to see the instant updates from another user. (hard)

   - Code:

     Class [act/AddPostPage](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7558707/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/antiscam/act/AddPostPage.java)

Feature Category: Peer to Peer Messaging

5. [P2P-DM] Provide users with the ability to message each other directly in private. All messages will be instantly received by both parties in the private conversation. (hard)

   - Code:

     Class [act/ChatActivity](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7558707/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/antiscam/act/ChatActivity.java)

6. [P2P-Block] Provide users with the ability to ‘block’ and prevent another user from direct messaging them. However, users can still send private messages to users they have blocked. Users who have been blocked will be unable to send private messages to the person who blocked them. (medium)

   - Code:

     Class act/ChatActivity

     ​	- Method [initBlock](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u7558707/ga-23s2/-/blob/main/src/app/src/main/java/com/example/antiscam/act/ChatActivity.java#L232-277)

2. xxx

We've done testing through two ways: white box, black box testing. And we've found bugs and solved some of them by debugging or logging to the console.

White box testing

In white box testing, we utilized the emulator to execute all our methods and code. Given our familiarity with the expected outcomes of the code, we tailored our tests accordingly. For example, we inspected the UI layout to confirm it aligned with our intended design. At the same time, we tested the search functionality by setting various search parameters and ensuring the results matched our expectations. This approach helped us detect and rectify certain overlooked errors.

We managed to successfully test some functionalities like "onCreate" or "onClick". By examining the specifics of the code within these methods, we could check if the appropriate actions were being triggered. For instance, if we clicked the button, we would certainly know if there was an error by looking at the interface and database to check if that's the right function we wanted to achieve.

### Conflict Resolution Protocol
*[Write a well defined protocol your team can use to handle conflicts. That is, if your group has problems, what is the procedure for reaching consensus or solving a problem?
(If you choose to make this an external document, link to it here)]*

This shall include an agreed procedure for situations including (but not limited to):
- e.g., if a member fails to meet the initial plan and/or deadlines
- e.g., if your group has issues, how will your group reach consensus or solve the problem?
- e.g., if a member gets sick, what is the solution? Alternatively, what is your plan to mitigate the impact of unforeseen incidents for this 6-to-8-week project?
