## Meeting Minutes
1.	Introduction of Two New App Scenarios:
- In this meeting, we introduced two additional app scenarios for consideration: 
- a. Historical Events Search App:
- This app would allow users to search for historical events, view detailed information about them, and access related multimedia content (e.g., photos, videos, articles).
- Users could explore historical events by date, location, and category (e.g., wars, scientific discoveries, cultural milestones). 
- b. Anti-Scamming App:
- The anti-scamming app would serve as a platform for users to share their experiences with scams and fraudulent activities.
- Users could post details of their scam encounters, including the type of scam, tactics used, and any supporting evidence.
- The app would also provide a search feature for users to check if they are currently facing a scam by comparing their experiences with reported cases.
2.	Decision on App Focus:
- After a thorough discussion, we decided to evaluate the four scenarios based on the following criteria:
- Market Demand: Which scenario addresses a more pressing need or problem?
- Data Availability: Do we have access to suitable datasets or sources for each scenario?
- Feasibility: Which scenario is more practical to implement within the given timeframe and resources?
- We decide to choose the second scenario, Anti-Scamming App.
